    "First, we mined the data ```[\"hi\", \"bye\", \"hello]``` to the blockchain with a difficulty of 2. What's happening here is that each element of this list is being verified on the chain (AKA mining). <br><br>Notice that the first block (called a genesis block) has a default previous hash of ```0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000```, which we defined above when we instantiated the Block object. <br><br>The nonce of the genesis block is 240, which means when we are mining ```\"hi\"``` to the chain, the computer had to try a new nonce (by increasing the nonce by 1) and computed a new hash 240 times until the output hash satisfied the difficulty requirements we set above. Verifying the second data element ```\"bye\"``` required 29 tries, and so forth. <br>A difficulty of ```2``` forces the computer to find a hash that starts with at least two zeroes. <br><br>\n",
    "As you increase the difficulty, you will see that the nonces increase substantially as we are forcing the requirements to be stricter. Not only do the nonces increase, but the time it takes for your computer to calculate and mine the data will also increase. This is why you may have heard that Proof-of-Work is computationally expensive and takes up large amounts of resources. In a real blockchain such as Ethereum, the consensus algorithms are much more rigorous.<br><br><i>Note: As of September 15th, 2022, Ethereum uses a Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm instead of PoW, which is less ~99% less computationally expensive.</i>"
