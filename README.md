# blockchain-simulation
This is a very simplified implementation of a blockchain written in a Python Notebook. <br>
Blockchains are secured by consensus algorithms, in this case I have shown how Proof-of-Work (PoW) works.
You can change the difficulty of the algorithm in the code and see that as you increase the difficulty, the time and computational power it takes to verify the blocks increases. <br>
